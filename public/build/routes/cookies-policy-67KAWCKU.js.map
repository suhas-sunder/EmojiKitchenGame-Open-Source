Cookies are widely used by\n            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more\n            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,\n            http://emojikitchengame.com) are called 'first-party cookies.'\n            Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called\n            'third-party cookies.' Third-party cookies enable third-party\n            features or functionality to be provided on or through the website\n            (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties\n            that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both\n            when it visits the website in question and also when it visits\n            certain other websites.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Google Analytics cookies and identifiers</h3>\n          <p>\n            Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on\n            visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers\u2019\n            websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.\n            In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser add-on\n            that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google\n            Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only\n            disables Google Analytics measurement. Where a site or app uses\n            Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs,\n            Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier \u2014 a randomly\n            generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App.\n            Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID\n            on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance\n            identifier is also reset. Where sites or apps have implemented\n            Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like Google\n            Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected.
